It was surprising because it should be a pretty straight-forward thing to predict (binary, good availability of data, evenly distributed classes). We found out then, that the data had actually some problems. Motile=true was a mixture of flagellated motility and gliding, which work completely different from a molecular point of view. When we eliminated the gliding data, the model improved a lot even though we had much less data. In the end, garbage in, garbage out is not the only way to describe it. You can have fairly good data but if you do not put enough thinking in how to build the training dataset, you can still fail. You still need to *know* the data good enough.

When working on big and unfamiliar projects for the first time claude/gemini have been great at interpreting log files, providing guidance on configuration and debugging. \n\nResearch: I use LLMs a lot to explore areas of interest quickly and (good or bad) often use it as a tool to check what I already believe to be the case.\n\nWriting/editing: I do not intend to use LLMs to help write my own grants/papers though I think they can have some use on providing feedback on the clarity of drafts. Within the company I'm currently working for they wanted to respond to an EU grant call at unrealistically short timescale. I was quite impressed by the ability of Gemini to digest all the general guidance, call-specific guidance, an outline of the idea, some slides and other internal data to rough out the core sections of the grant. This saved a lot of time in the sense that it gave a first draft that could then be (extensively edited). I think this approach might be reasonale for funders that have large and rather formulaic grant forms.\n\nTranslations: really useful\n\nPersonal: found Gemin very useful to explore and understand contract issues that were relevant to the employment of a family member.",

Another example is when merging two tables, it might accumulate certain parameters (using +=) and insert that result into the merged dataframe.\nWhen conducting research for academic questions that require support from research articles, I have often found that the reference links provided by the AI cannot be opened. Furthermore, I can't find these sources with a Google search. So I cannot trust the answers or conclusions it provides. ( Free version of ChatGPT).",
