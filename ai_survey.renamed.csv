When working on big and unfamiliar projects for the first time claude/gemini have been great at interpreting log files, providing guidance on configuration and debugging. 

Research: I use LLMs a lot to explore areas of interest quickly and (good or bad) often use it as a tool to check what I already believe to be the case.

Writing/editing: I do not intend to use LLMs to help write my own grants/papers though I think they can have some use on providing feedback on the clarity of drafts. Within the company I'm currently working for they wanted to respond to an EU grant call at unrealistically short timescale. I was quite impressed by the ability of Gemini to digest all the general guidance, call-specific guidance, an outline of the idea, some slides and other internal data to rough out the core sections of the grant. This saved a lot of time in the sense that it gave a first draft that could then be (extensively edited). I think this approach might be reasonale for funders that have large and rather formulaic grant forms.
